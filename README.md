# JSLinux Mobile â€“ Linux for UWPA mobile version of a PC emulator written in Javascript, with a running, fully functional Linux system. The emulator can be run offline in full-screen mode on Windows Mobile and Desktop devices.As this is a fork of [JSLinux for iOS](https://github.com/jaromaz/jslinux-mobile) this has the same support for touch keyboards as that. But this is my WIP version, features will hopefully be addedWhat changes are made currently:- RAM amount now changed to 16 - 512MB- Changed default console columns and rows to not be cut off by Windows Mobile touch keyboardOriginal JSLinux for iOS: Copyright (c) 2021 Jaromaz [jm.iq.pl](https://jm.iq.pl/en)
