# JSLinux Mobile â€“ Linux for UWPA mobile version of a PC emulator written in Javascript, with a running, fully functional Linux system. The emulator can be run offline in full-screen mode on Windows Mobile and Desktop devices.As this is a fork of [JSLinux for iOS](https://github.com/jaromaz/jslinux-mobile)  this has the same support for touch keyboards as that, also [jslinux-tap](https://github.com/killinux/jslinux-tap) has been used to experiment with trying to get networking locally yover websocket. But this is my WIP version, features will hopefully be added### What changes are made currently:- Switched over to [jslinux-tap](https://github.com/killinux/jslinux-tap) to try to get networking with websockets workin glocally in UWP (no progress with this yet)- Modified jslinux-tap to use the jslinux-mobile ui changes### Changes in jslinux-mobile (currently not used, switched to [jslinux-tap](https://github.com/killinux/jslinux-tap))- (Experimental) Clock speed set to 1000MHz.. this has some negative impact and makes boot a lot slower, and sluggish so tweaking is needed for the code handling cpu cycles i believe- RAM amount now changed to 16 - 512MB- Changed default console columns and rows to not be cut off by Windows Mobile touch keyboard### Notes:- No network connectivity *yet*- No local storage persistence *yet*Original JSLinux for iOS: Copyright (c) 2021 Jaromaz [jm.iq.pl](https://jm.iq.pl/en)Original JSLinux-tap [killinux](https://github.com/killinux/)
